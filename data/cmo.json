EAE is an animal model of brain inflammation in which inflammation is induced through immunization of the animal with central nervous system antigens or by the passive transfer of autoreactive T cells. Acute EAE is a variant of EAE having a short, monophasic timecourse of symptoms which are usually severe, followed by complete and stable recovery.",

Lymph nodes are any of the accumulations of lymphoid tissue organized as definite lymphoid organs along the course of lymphatic vessels, consisting of an outer cortical and an inner medullary part; they are the main source of lymphocytes of the peripheral blood and, as part of the reticuloendothelial system, serve as a defense mechanism by removing noxious agents, e.g., bacteria and toxins, and probably play a role in antibody formation.

The normalized kidney weight is the weight of the kidney corrected for body weight using an empirically determined allometric scaling factor (i.e., an exponential factor which adjusts for the normal increase in kidney weight due to normal growth and development of the individual). Compensatory growth is the phenomenon in which the impaired function of one organ in a paired organ system or of part of an organ in a single organ system is followed by enlargement of the surviving organ or tissue so that functional capacity is maintained. Kidney is the paired organ which functions to maintain proper water and electrolyte balance, regulate acid-base concentration, and filter the blood of metabolic wastes.",
