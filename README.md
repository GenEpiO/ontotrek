OntoTrek is an OBOFoundry.org ontology terminology viewer that takes advantage of 3d graph rendering software. Currently it displays all classes and subclasses but no axioms. We have a few ontologies to choose from during this alpha/beta phase. OntoTrek color codes terms by their ontology prefix so that one can visually see which ontologies are at play.  (A future version could involve adding other relations besides class-subclass).

OntoTrek is under development at Hsiao Labs which is associated with the University of British Columbia Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and with the PHSA Public Health Laboratory at the British Columbia Centre For Disease Control.

Details of javascript and file generation are in /js/common.js. To summarise:

  To update 3d-force-graph run this in ontotrek root folder:
  
  > npm update 

  To update /js/bundle.js which needs latest 3d-force-graph, need to run 
  browserify.org's "browserify" command. To load it (may need sudo su):

  > npm install -g browserify
  > npm install uniq 

  Then in /js folder, regenerate bundle.js based on super-basic index.js

  > browserify index.js -o bundle.js

The json data file being examined in /data/ is generated by ontofetch.py
from an OWL ontology file.
