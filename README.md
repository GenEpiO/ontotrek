OntoTrek is an OBOFoundry.org ontology terminology viewer that takes advantage of 3d graph rendering software. Currently it displays all class-subclass relations starting from owl:Entity or BFO:0000001 Entity. We have a few ontologies to choose from during this alpha/beta phase. OntoTrek color codes terms by their ontology prefix so that one can visually see which ontologies are at play.

It is under development at Hsiao Labs which is associated with the University of British Columbia Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and with the PHSA Public Health Laboratory at the British Columbia Centre For Disease Control.
